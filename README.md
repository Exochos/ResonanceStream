1. Legal & Business Setup

    Choose a business name and check domain availability.
    Register your LLC:
        Research state-specific requirements.
        File LLC paperwork (can be done online in most states).
    Obtain an EIN (Employer Identification Number) from the IRS.
    Open a business bank account and set up payment processors (Stripe, PayPal).
    Draft a basic business plan:
        Mission statement.
        Revenue model: Collar sales + subscription service.
        Budget allocation.
    Secure basic liability insurance for product and operations.

2. Hardware Development
Prototype Stage

    Finalize hardware requirements:
        GPS module, LTE module, accelerometer, power management, and wireless charging.
    Purchase prototyping components:
        ZX905 board or equivalent, battery, antennas, etc.
        Development boards like the Walter or Nordic Thingy:91 for testing.
    Test individual components:
        Connect and debug GPS, LTE, and accelerometer modules.
    Design and 3D print a temporary enclosure.

Transition to Custom PCB

    Finalize the feature set for a custom PCB.
    Hire a PCB designer or use DIY tools (e.g., KiCad).
    Source components from reliable suppliers.
    Send the design to a PCB foundry (e.g., JLCPCB) for prototypes.
    Test the assembled PCB with all components.

3. Software Development
Backend

    Choose a cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Supabase for simplicity).
    Design the backend schema:
        Tables for user accounts, device data, subscription tracking.
    Set up the server:
        Implement MQTT for real-time data or REST API for periodic updates.
    Develop endpoints for:
        Device registration.
        Data logging (GPS, battery, steps).
        Subscription management.
    Secure the backend:
        Use JWTs for authentication.
        Encrypt data in transit and at rest.

Frontend

    Build the customer-facing dashboard:
        Map interface for tracking dog location.
        Charts for fitness data (steps, activity).
        Subscription management UI.
    Create the admin panel:
        User account management.
        Monitoring devices and subscriptions.
    Optimize for mobile and desktop.

4. Subscription Service

    Set up a recurring payment system (e.g., Stripe, Paddle).
    Integrate billing with the backend:
        Automate account suspension for missed payments.
        Generate invoices.
    Test ultra-low-cost data plans with providers like Soracom or Hologram.
    Optimize device data usage to fit within the cheapest data plan.

5. Manufacturing

    Design the production enclosure:
        Choose materials (plastic or aluminum with a GPS window).
        Add weatherproofing features.
    Source manufacturers for:
        Enclosures (3D printing for prototypes; injection molding for production).
        Custom PCBs.
        Final assembly.
    Run a small production batch (e.g., 50 units) for beta testing.

6. Marketing & Sales

    Build a simple landing page:
        Highlight features and benefits.
        Include a call-to-action for preorders or waitlist signups.
    Set up social media accounts (Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn).
    Launch a Kickstarter or crowdfunding campaign to gauge interest and raise funds.
    Target early adopters:
        Pet bloggers, dog trainers, and tech-savvy pet owners.
    Gather testimonials and reviews from beta testers.
    Prepare for an official product launch:
        Paid ads on Google, Facebook, and Instagram.
        Collaborate with pet influencers.

7. Operations & Scaling

    Set up a support system:
        FAQ page and ticketing system (e.g., Zendesk).
        Email and live chat support for troubleshooting.

    Refine production and supply chain logistics:
        Negotiate better rates with suppliers.
        Streamline assembly processes.

    Monitor recurring revenue and churn rates:
        Focus on improving customer retention.

    Start planning v2 of the collar:
        Add advanced sensors (e.g., heart rate, SpO2).
        Introduce more features in the subscription app.

Breakdown by Priority

    Immediate: LLC setup, prototype assembly, backend and frontend MVP.
    Short Term: Marketing landing page, beta test units, secure funding.
    Medium Term: Production scaling, subscription service optimization.
    Long Term: Advanced features, app updates, market expansion.

Tools to Use

    Project Management: Trello, Asana, or Notion.
    Design: Figma (UI), Fusion 360 (hardware enclosures).
    Development: Supabase (backend), React (frontend).
    Manufacturing: JLCPCB (PCBs), Alibaba (components).
